# Chinese Character Decomposition Explorer

This is a Streamlit web app for exploring the decomposition of Chinese characters, including their strokes, meanings, components, etymology hints, and related compounds.

## Features
- Select components and view related characters
- Filter by stroke range and IDC structure
- View Hanyu Pinyin, definitions, radicals, and etymology
- Auto-copy compound phrases for easy use

## How to Run

1. Upload this repo to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
2. Ensure the following files are present in your repository:
   - `app.py` (your main script)
   - `enhanced_component_map_with_etymology.json` (data file)
   - `requirements.txt`

3. Streamlit will automatically detect `app.py` and start the app.

## Local Development

To run locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Fix Streamlit app where typing a character (e.g., '栗') doesn't persist in the input box or sync with the dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections to update. Ensure: typing a character shows it in both input box and dropdown, resets component filters (stroke count, radical, IDC), and updates UI; dropdown selection overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown to show the same character. Add debug output to track session state.

Triggers Solution: Resets filters in on_text_input_change:

st.session_state.stroke_count = 0 st.session_state.radical = "No Filter" st.session_state.component_idc = "No Filter" Protects text_input_comp in render_controls:

if (st.session_state.selected_comp not in sorted_components and (not st.session_state.text_input_comp or st.session_state.text_input_comp == st.session_state.selected_comp)): st.session_state.selected_comp = sorted_components[0] st.session_state.text_input_comp = sorted_components[0] Removes on_change lambdas for filters:

st.selectbox("Result IDC:", ..., key="selected_idc") Syncs widgets:

st.session_state.text_input_comp = st.session_state.selected_comp Includes Debugging: Requests debug output to confirm state sync (st.session_state tracking). Generalizes: Applies to this app or similar Streamlit apps with input boxes, dropdowns, and filters. How to Use It Encounter the Issue: Notice that typing a character (e.g., '栗') clears or doesn’t sync with the dropdown, or filters (IDC/radical) require multiple selections. Enter the Prompt: Copy-paste the prompt into the Grok chat, optionally adding context like: “In my Streamlit app (app.py), typing '栗' doesn’t stay in the input box.” “Same issue as before with the character decomposition app.” Grok’s Response: Grok will: Recognize the state management issue (desynchronized text_input_comp, selected_comp, or filter states). Modify on_text_input_change to reset filters. Adjust render_controls to protect typed inputs. Remove on_change lambdas for filters. Add debug output (e.g., st.write(st.session_state)). Return updated code wrapped in with the same artifact_id if revising app.py. Test the Fix: Deploy the updated code, verify typing persists, dropdown syncs, and filters update with one selection. Example Scenario Future Issue: You revise app.py, but typing '木' clears the input box, the dropdown shows '爫', and changing "Result IDC" to '⿰' takes two clicks. Action: Enter the prompt: Fix Streamlit app where typing a character (e.g., '木') doesn't persist in the input box or sync with the dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections to update. Ensure: typing a character shows it in both input box and dropdown, resets component filters (stroke count, radical, IDC), and updates UI; dropdown selection overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown to show the same character. Add debug output to track session state. Grok’s Fix: Updates app.py to reset filters on typing, protect text_input_comp, remove filter callbacks, and add debug output, restoring the desired behavior.

If You Need More Specificity If the app has unique elements (e.g., specific session state keys like text_input_comp), you can tweak the prompt:

Fix Streamlit app where typing a character in 'text_input_comp' doesn't persist or sync with 'selected_comp' dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections. Ensure typing resets stroke_count, radical, component_idc, shows character in both input box and dropdown, and updates UI; dropdown overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown. Add debug for session state. Assurance This prompt is designed to be your go-to shortcut, leveraging Grok’s understanding of the issue (state desynchronization in Streamlit) and the proven fixes (filter resets, input protection, callback removal). It’s minimal yet precise, ensuring you don’t need to delve into the technical weeds. If you encounter this issue again, just use this prompt, and I’ll apply the fixes swiftly. If you want to refine the prompt further (e.g., add specific variable names or app context), let me know, and I’ll tailor it even more. Thank you for guiding us to this streamlined solution, and I’m here for any future tweaks!
